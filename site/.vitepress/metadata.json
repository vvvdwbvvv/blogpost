In this post, I would give a minor introduction on Reinforcement Learning, its basic concepts and methods.\n\n"},{"title":"Neural Architecture Search","href":"/posts/neural-architecture-search.html","date":{"time":1644667200000,"string":"February 12, 2022"},"excerpt":" \nThe needs for appropriate deep neural networks for most modern problems have increased dramatically, and finding the right architecture is a challenge. Almost deep architectures nowadays are manually designed with tremendous times of trial-and-errors and state-of-the-arts are those with multiple layers,  connections ignoring a suitable explanation. \n\n"},{"title":"Leukocyte classification to predict diseases (Part 2)","href":"/posts/computer-vision-for-leukocyte-prediction-2.html","date":{"time":1632398400000,"string":"September 23, 2021"},"excerpt":"Data analysis on number of blood cells, which are white blood cells and red blood cells, per a certain blood volume could help us observe our medical situation.
